# Nikiro_simulation
Nikiro_simulation is a ROS 2-based simulation framework for the Nikiro Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) platform. It is designed for indoor navigation using a differential drive system and provides seamless integration with Gazebo, RViz, and Nav2 for:

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

Localization

Path Planning

This repository primarily focuses on the simulation aspects of both the MyCobot robotic arm and the AMR, offering a modular and extensible setup for research, development, and testing.

# ðŸš€ Features

  **Differential Drive Simulation:** Accurately simulates AMR movement with a differential drive system.
  
  **Modular Architecture:** Easily extend or customize components like sensors, controllers, and robot arms.
  
  **SLAM Integration:** Supports SLAM using tools like slam_toolbox for real-time map building.
  
  **Localization:** Enables localization using AMCL and Nav2's lifecycle nodes.
  
  **Path Planning & Navigation:** Utilizes Nav2 stack for robust path planning, obstacle avoidance, and goal reaching.
  
  **Gazebo Simulation:** Full integration with Gazebo Classic for 3D physics-based simulation.
  
  **RViz Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the robot, sensors, maps, and paths in RViz2.
  
  **Multi-Robot Ready:** Easily scalable to support multiple robots in simulation.
  
  **MyCobot Arm Simulation:** Integrates the MyCobot 6-DOF robotic arm for manipulation tasks.
  Object Detection Support.

# INSTALLATION
```
mkdir -p nikiro_simulation/src
cd nikiro_simulation/src
git clone https://github.com/logesh1516/Nikiro_simulation.git
cd ..
colcon build
```
# SIMULATION 

```
cd nikiro_simulation
source install/setup.bash
```
**AMR SIMULATION**
```
ros2 launch amr_description gazebo.launch.py
```
to map the environment use this command

```
ros2 launch amr_description mapping.launch.py
```
to perform nav2 navigation use this command
```
ros2 launch amr_description nav2.launch.py
```
**CONVEYOR SIMULATION**

**Basic simulation**

```sh
cd ~/colcon_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch conveyor_description conveyor_model.launch.py 
```
Spawning Objects over the Conveyor

a) Single object

```sh
cd ~/colcon_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt SpawnObject.py --package "conveyor_description" --urdf "redcube.urdf" --name "redcube" --x -0.2 --y 0 --z 1
(or)
ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt SpawnObject.py --package "conveyor_description" --urdf "bluecube.urdf" --name "bluecube" --x -0.2 --y 0 --z 1
(or)
ros2 run ros2_conveyorbelt SpawnObject.py --package "conveyor_description" --urdf "greencube.urdf" --name "greencube" --x -0.2 --y 0 --z 1
```
through this command only red,green and bluecubes can be spawned.

b) Multiple Object

I have created a python script to spawn multiple objects over the conveyor.

Each object can be spawned only once.

```sh
cd colcon_ws
source install/setup.bash
cd ~/src/Conveyor_simulation/ros2_conveyorbelt/python
python3 summoner.py
```
**Simulation of the conveyor**

a) Manual power input

Activate the ConveyorBelt with the desired speed -> Value = (0,100]:

```sh
cd ~/colcon_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 service call /CONVEYORPOWER conveyorbelt_msgs/srv/ConveyorBeltControl "{power: --}"

```
b) Conveyor Automation using Ir sensors

Two IR sensors are placed in the start and end position of the conveyor for the automation depending on the presence of the object.

```sh
cd ~/colcon_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run conveyor_automation conveyor_automation_node
```
**Mycobot_simulation**

```
ros2 launch mycobot_gazebo mycobotjn_control.launch.py
```
to move the mycobot-arm 
```
ros2 run mycobot_gazebo pick_and_place
```
