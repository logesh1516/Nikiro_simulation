Nikiro is a ROS 2-based Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) platform designed for indoor navigation using a differential drive system. Built with modularity and simulation in mind, Nikiro leverages Gazebo, RViz, and Nav2 for SLAM, localization, and path planning.This repo focuses on the simulation of the mycobot and amr.
